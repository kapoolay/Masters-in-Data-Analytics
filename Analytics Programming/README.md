# 📊 Analytics Programming Project

This repository contains my project work for the **Analytics Programming** course. The course builds foundational skills in Python for data analysis, cleaning, and visualization — essential tools for working as a data analyst or data engineer.

The tasks in this repository demonstrate my ability to write, document, and present analytic code that answers business questions using real-world data.

## 🧩 Course Topics Covered

- Data import and validation (CSV, Excel)
- Data structures in Python (lists, dictionaries, DataFrames)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with `pandas`
- Error handling and validation logic
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Calculating key financial ratios (e.g. debt-to-income, debt-to-equity)
- Data grouping, filtering, and aggregation
- Custom data visualizations using `matplotlib`
- Presenting code functionality through narrated video walkthroughs (Panopto)

## 📦 Project Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Analysis

- Loaded business data from Excel into a DataFrame
- Identified duplicates and handled them appropriately
- Examined key features and data quality issues

### Task 2: Financial Ratio Analysis

- Filtered business records based on predefined rules
- Calculated and validated financial ratios using conditional logic
- Wrote reusable Python functions to process data and handle edge cases
- Exported the cleaned and filtered data

### Task 3: Data Visualization

- Created custom visualizations using `matplotlib`
- Designed bar charts and line plots to highlight debt profiles by state
- Visualized frequency distributions and patterns in key metrics

### Presentation Script

- Prepared and recorded a narrated walkthrough of the project using Panopto
- Highlighted functionality, design choices, and Python version used
