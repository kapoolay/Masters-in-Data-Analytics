## üìö Project Overview  

This project emphasizes the crucial role of data preparation and exploration in analytics. It covers:  

- Cleaning data to ensure accuracy and quality  
- Interpreting descriptive and inferential statistics  
- Visualizing and exploring data  
- Wrangling data for further analysis  
- Applying **hypothesis testing** with parametric tests  
- Communicating findings to stakeholders

## üì¶ Project Breakdown  

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Cleaned and profiled the raw dataset to ensure structure, accuracy, and quality.  
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
- Produced descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
- Highlighted early trends in customer demographics and purchasing behavior.  

### Task 2: Hypothesis Testing & Statistical Analysis  
- Defined a research question and formulated null/alternative hypotheses.  
- Applied **parametric tests** (e.g., Welch‚Äôs t-test, ANOVA) to compare group means.  
- Calculated p-values and interpreted statistical significance.  
- Explained results in a business context to guide decision-making.  

### Task 3: Market Basket Analysis (Allias Megastore)  
- Selected and encoded categorical variables (ordinal, nominal).  
- Transactionalized dataset for market basket analysis.  
- Applied the **Apriori algorithm** using Python‚Äôs `mlxtend` library.  
- Generated and evaluated association rules with **support, confidence, and lift**.  
- Identified frequently purchased product combinations.  
- Recommended retail strategies such as bundling and targeted promotions.
